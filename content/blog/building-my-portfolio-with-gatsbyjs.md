## Why Gatsby?

Gatsby is a static site generator that's used to build Progressive Web Apps.  It follows the latest web standards and is optimized to be highly performant.  

It also makes use of latest and popular technologies such as React, Webpack, and GraphQL.

I chose to use Gatsby for many reasons. 

#### Performance

First, it's built with performance in mind.  The framework takes care of performance on its own, so there's no need to worry about that.  Basically, what it does is gets the source code you've created and Gatsby takes care of the rest compiling the most performant Webpack configuration to build your site.  I know performance doesn't really matter too much for a static portfolio site, but as a developer, I just like to have the peace of mind knowing that my site is super fast :)

#### Popular and Latest Technologies

Second, as I mentioned before, it uses a lot of the latest and popular technologies.  React is something I enjoy and have been using for more than 2 years now, so I already knew I wanted to use Gatsby.  It also uses GraphQL, which is something I've always wanted to work with.  

#### CMS

I wanted to create a blog to write about what I've been working on, what I'm learning, etc.  With Gatsby, it's easy to connect with a CMS like Netlify which gave me the ability to create blog posts super fast, as I just have to type my post within an editor and it automatically gets transformed into a blog post on my site.

#### Simplifies Development Process

It really simplified the entire development process.  I've been able to finish most of the site in a single day.  A lot of the packages needed to build a site is built right into the framework, such as react-router and GraphQL, which gave me a few less things to worry about.  Also, hosting the site to Netlify was scarily easy.  All I had to do was push my code onto GitHub, connect Netlify to my Git repository, and deploy.  It's that simple.  As I push my changes onto GitHub, Netlify handles the rest since they offer continuous deployment that automatically triggers a new build.  

Overall, I really enjoyed working with Gatsby.  I'll probably use it again in the future as there's just so many different use cases for it.
