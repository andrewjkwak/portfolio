title: Building My Own Résumé Template
description: Figuring out how I can build my own resume, exactly the way I want it to be.

## The Issue with Résumé

I've never been satisfied with my own résumé ever since I first created one.  The reason being that I never had creative control over exactly how I wanted it to look like.  Like most people, I'm assuming you guys just search on Google for a résumé template, find the one that you're somewhat satisfied in, and then fill it out with your information.  

And there's nothing wrong with that.  But, for me personally, I am very particular with my design choices and for even something like a résumé where a template would work just fine since what's most important is the content of the résumé itself, I cannot be satisfied until it suits my design preference.  If this relates to you as well, then I'll explain the entire process of what I went through, and how I officially built a résumé I'm proud of.

## LaTeX

I created my old résumé using Microsoft Word, with a generic template I found online (image above).  I'm pretty sure it's the most popular template since I've seen it so many times already.  I wanted full customization so the first thing that came to mind was using LaTeX.  For those of you that do not know what LaTeX is, it's a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting.  It's mainly used for scientific documents, research papers, etc.  The only issue is, there's a big learning curve.  I took an attempt at that briefly and eventually gave up since it would've taken me many hours or days to build my résumé and also, I actually have no use of even learning LaTeX since I'd probably never use it again so decided it'd be a waste of time.  I realized there's an easier alternative - HTML and CSS.

## HTML and CSS

Being a web developer, I thought why not just create a static web page for my résumé and then I can just convert it into a PDF file after I'm done.  The only real issue was, how would I create a site that can easily be converted into a PDF that matches the size of an A4 paper document?  For something that seems so trivial, seems to require an insane amount of effort.  What I wanted was a simple editor where I have full control over a document, inputting text boxes wherever I want.  Something very similar to OneNote.   That's when I had my "Aha!" moment and realized Adobe InDesign is exactly what I needed!

## InDesign

Adobe InDesign is an application literally used to create documents like brochures, pamphlets, advertisements, books, etc.  For something like building a résumé, there's no learning curve whatsoever.  It's an intuitive application and all I really had to do was create a couple of text boxes, add some lines as reference for my layout, and update the styling.  Yes, it does cost money, but they also have a 7-day free trial and all you really need is a couple of hours to build something you're proud of.  It honestly can't get easier than this.  I'd even say it's easier to use than Microsoft Word except way better since I had full creative control to create the design exactly how I wanted it, and all I had to do was drag a couple of text boxes around.  It required no tutorial whatsoever. 

That's all there is to it.  So if you're not satisfied with your résumé and would like to design the layout yourself, try it out!  You'll be surprised at how easy and fun it is to work with!

Here's how I created the layout of my résumé and the final result :)

Thanks for reading.
